            <p class="purpose-text">
                There's a downright scarcity of spaces in Kingston (maybe Jamaica overall) that select for and encourage bright, curious, and interesting people to indulge in the kind of stimulating activities that are meaningfully enriching to them.
            </p>

            <p class="purpose-text">
                Kingston Book Club serves to fill that gap. Being more ambitious, we want to do that and provide the kind of space that enables people to grow and be challenged and find other people that are into that kind of thing too.
            </p>

            <p class="purpose-text">
                Expanding on that even more, we want to push people to Think, while also not holding any ideas too close to their chest. We are building whatever the opposite of a monolith of thought is. Think of this as some cerebral run club. Whatever the dorky analog to a 5k is, we do that every week so you can hit some intellectual goals, and then more.

            <ol class="membership-list">
                <li>You are above the age of 18.</li>
                <li>You are willing and able to read the selected text and keep in step with the group's progress.</li>
                <li>You can maintain responsible and civic conduct. Also that you're kind and respectful. This is non-negotiable.</li>
                <li>You're able to accept that perspectives can vary and are willing to handle that in a productive manner. This one is huge because we'll inevitably have debates.</li>
                <li>(Nice to have) You are able to purchase the selected text. This can look like an expense of maybe ~$12 USD or ~$2000 JMD per book.</li>
                <li>You are able to attend our meetings on a regular basis. They are held weekly, but we do permit some lenience for extenuating circumstances. Building the habit and community is really important though.</li>
            </ol>

It's really important that everyone is attentive and we do select a winner based on who most effectively sways the audience to their POV. It's fun!

                        The main block of the meeting is dedicated to open-ended discussion questions - usually 2 or 3. This will look like the moderator dishing out a thought-provoking prompt to the members and then the point being discussed. We try to keep the conversation flowing and it's really important that we give the floor to whoever has <em>the ball</em>.

                        Finally, the last 20-30 minutes of our meetings is reserved for socializing and taking group photos. Don't leave right after the discussions are over! At this point we might also have some refreshments that other members have brought.

                        The ball is sacrosanct. It's how we recognize the main speaker at a given point in time and we <em>always</em> defer and listen to the holder of the ball. This ensures that everyone can get their point out. The ball holds great power in a meeting so its use demands responsibility - no hogging please. The ball might come in a variety of forms and textures - smooth, round, oblong, spiky. The ball represents order within our meetings.

                        No. Online meetings typically devolve into muted mics and cameras turned off with maybe a narrow selection of people actually engaging. The main aim of this club is community so we'll keep it face-to-face. Also, in-person is more soulful.

                        I'd encourage you to follow our social media instead where you can read along with us. The WhatsApp group is intended for those who can attend.

                        That's completely fine. We will keep you updated on our progress on whichever text is being read so you can read along with us. It is required that you have read the particular sections up for discussion to participate in our meetings though. It's also expected that you will be able to attend at some regular cadence. If you haven't made it to a meeting in 2 months for instance then this would be counter to the idea of membership.
