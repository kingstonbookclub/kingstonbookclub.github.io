# Kingston Book Club Website - Jekyll Conversion

This package contains all the files needed to convert your site to Jekyll.

## Files Included:

### Configuration
- `_config.yml` - Main Jekyll configuration

### Data Files (`_data/` folder)
These YAML files contain editable content:
- `current-reading.yml` - Book information, quote, links
- `short-reading.yml` - Article list + toggle on/off
- `gallery.yml` - Gallery images list
- `events.yml` - Upcoming events (4 cards)
- `previous-meetings.yml` - Last 4 meetings

### Blog Posts (`_posts/` folder)
Sample blog posts (7 total):
- 5 posts from 2026
- 2 posts from 2025

### What's Next:
1. Upload these files to your GitHub repository
2. Wait for GitHub Pages to rebuild (1-2 minutes)
3. Test the site
4. Then we'll add the CMS admin panel!

## File Naming Rules for Blog Posts:
- Must be named: `YYYY-MM-DD-title.md`
- Must be in `_posts/` folder
- Jekyll will automatically sort by date

## Editing Content:
Once Decap CMS is set up, you'll edit through a visual interface.
For now, you can edit the YAML files directly on GitHub.
