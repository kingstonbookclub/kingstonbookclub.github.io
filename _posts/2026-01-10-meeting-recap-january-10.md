This was our first meeting. We introduced concepts such as "the ball", established clear rules of engagement, and had a fun icebreaker prepared by Kimberly.

Our discussion was based on the first 2 chapters of The Righteous Mind by Jonathan Haidt. Members engaged thoughtfully with the material and shared diverse perspectives.

The energy was fantastic and we're excited for future meetings!
