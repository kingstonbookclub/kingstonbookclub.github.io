Welcome to the Kingston Book Club website! We're a community of readers in Kingston, Jamaica fostering intellectual discourse.

Our goal is to build and maintain a community of interesting people by connecting them with fresh ideas through literature. We see knowledge as a good in and of itself.

Stay tuned for announcements about our first meeting and book selection. We can't wait to meet you!
