This was our fifth meeting and the first meeting where I decided to relinquish my hold on the discussion questions.
A typical question from me was met with a general response of "huh?" and "wait...what?" so I took that cue and decided to delegate this to a MUCH better discussion prepper - Anna!

Here are the questions she carefully curated for our meeting:

1.⁠ ⁠Is reciprocal altruism inherently selfish? If so, how does politics target this aspect of the fairness module?
  
2.⁠ ⁠Does the Jamaican culture demand a lot of respect to authority figures? Does this respect come from fear or expectations of those in charge?
  
3.⁠ ⁠⁠Do you agree with Kass’ statement that technology often erases moral boundaries? If so, should we stop the production of technology?
  
4.⁠ ⁠⁠Do you agree with Haidt’s view of the right relying on all five moral foundations, whild the left only leans on two (Care and Fairness)?
  
5.⁠ ⁠⁠Does Haidt argue that conservatives are more morally in tune, or that they are more easily triggered? Based on your answer, is it better to rely on all five moral foundations?
  
6.⁠ ⁠⁠Which world would you prefer to live in: Mill’s social contract society, based on tenets of diversity and autonomy, or Durkheim’s duty-oriented loyalist society? Which of these is Jamaica closer to?

And here's the general recap from the meeting:

-⁠  ⁠PJ conducted a fun icebreaker with aeroplanes and we learned quirky facts about each other
 
-⁠  ⁠Early attendees now get a Kiss (the chocolate treat) -- come within the first 10 mins. Should be an incentive for early attendance 
 
-⁠  ⁠Attendance count: 17 
 
-⁠  ⁠We got through all our discussion questions. They were prepared by Anna and people really responded to them. The debate got most heated on questions 3&4
 
-⁠  ⁠Amanda baked and brought vanilla cake. Smash hit. 10/10 
 
-⁠  ⁠We had a bunch of first timers, about 4. They liked the meeting! We should try to warm up to them a bit more in our post-discussion chats though.
 

For our next meeting we'll be having the icebreaker prepped by Yours Truly and it will be Valentine's Day themed.
