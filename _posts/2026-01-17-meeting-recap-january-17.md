Our second meeting covered Chapters 3 & 4 of The Righteous Mind. Kimberly prepared a fun icebreaker with balloons.

We discovered some members were put off by popping them - lesson learned for future activities. The discussion was lively and covered key concepts about moral foundations theory.

Overall, a productive session with great participation from all members.
