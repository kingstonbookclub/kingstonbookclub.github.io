Short form reads! 

We had our first meeting dedicated to short-form reads. The 3rd meeting of every month we'll get some member-recommended texts together to try and add some diversity to our reading.

We had some fantastic picks for this meeting. 

To recap we discussed:
- ⁠⁠whether choosing political leadership is a strong or weak-link problem
- ⁠⁠⁠what shapes the modern occult comes in
- ⁠⁠⁠how religiosity/secularism varies by demographics
- ⁠⁠⁠if secularism can sufficiently fill the gap left by religion
