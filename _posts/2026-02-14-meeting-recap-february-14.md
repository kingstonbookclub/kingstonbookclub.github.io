Valentines is all about love, gifts and the discussion of free-riders and welfare in our society.

No? How about debating whether or not our culture supports hive-like behaviours? Well the Kingston bookclub certainly celebrated the festive day a bit differently with our discussions primarily centred around a few topics from our current weekly read, The Righteous Mind. 

The opinions, points of view and approach to the questions asked really had me second-guessing my own morals. We discussed welfare and free-riders, about how our society makes an approach on these arguments and believe me when I say, words were said that made our leader sneak in a quick empathy lesson. 

We tackled “hive-switch” and “group-ish-ness”, words that were polished and presented from the book’s perspective. With all our serious discussions however, Valentines Day was properly celebrated with anonymous compliments on cards, (Totally love by the way!) and chocolates. 

This meet was ranked the best we’ve had in a while, or second best from me personally. What could our next meet behold?
